# Aspose.HTML for Java – Data Extraction Examples

This gist repository contains practical Java snippets that show how to extract data and resources from HTML pages and websites using Aspose.HTML for Java: images, icons, inline and external SVGs, text nodes, and full pages with controllable resource handling. These gists are used in the Aspose.HTML for Java documentation, particularly in the [Data Extraction](https://docs.aspose.com/html/java/data-extraction/) chapter.

## Topics Covered

1. Select, navigate, and filter HTML to find target data using CSS selectors, `TreeWalker`, and a custom `NodeFilter`.
2. Extract resources from web pages: download images, icons, and SVG (inline and external).
3. Inspect and navigate HTML documents to read text, attributes, and structure.
4. Save full web pages with control over which linked resources are retrieved via `HTMLSaveOptions`, `ResourceHandlingOptions`, `MaxHandlingDepth`, and `PageUrlRestriction`.
5. Perform direct network requests to fetch arbitrary files via `RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage`.

## What's Included?

This gist repository contains individual Java examples focused on data extraction workflows:

## What's Included?

* **DOM Traversal.** Navigate the DOM tree to inspect, read, and extract elements and text content from HTML documents.
* **Node Filtering.** Use custom filters and `TreeWalker` to process only specific nodes, such as images or selected tags.
* **CSS Selectors.** Use `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` to quickly find elements by tag, class, or attribute.
* **Extract Images and Icons.** Collect and download images, site icons, and other visual resources from web pages.
* **Download SVG from a Website.** Extract inline SVG elements or download external SVG files for later use.
* **Inspect and Analyze HTML.** Parse and explore document structure, attributes, and metadata.
* **Save Web Pages.** Download entire websites or individual pages with advanced options like `MaxHandlingDepth` and `PageUrlRestriction` to control resources.
* **Fetch Files by URL.** Perform direct requests to download and save arbitrary files from the web.
