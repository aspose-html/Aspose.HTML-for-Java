# Code Examples for Checking Web Accessibility

This gist repository contains Java examples that accompany the [Web Accessibility](https://docs.aspose.com/html/java/web-accessibility/) chapter in the Aspose.HTML for Java documentation. These examples demonstrate how to validate HTML content for accessibility in accordance with the WCAG standard, enabling the identification of errors and warnings.

## What's Included?

This repository contains Java examples that demonstrate how to implement and manage web accessibility features in HTML documents using the Aspose.HTML library for Java. Here you will find code that illustrates:

- Check web documents against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards using built-in validators and predefined rule sets.
- Check for alternative text in image elements to ensure accessibility for screen readers.
- Evaluate color contrast and compare it to accessibility standards, and assess multimedia elements to ensure they comply with accessibility guidelines.
- Create reports that detail accessibility violations found in an HTML document.
- Customize availability checking and use specific rule sets to control the level and focus of analysis.
- Access accessibility principles, guidelines, and criteria directly through the Aspose.HTML for Java API.
